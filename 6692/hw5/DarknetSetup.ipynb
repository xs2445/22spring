    "In this Lab you will train YOLOv4-Tiny using the Darknet framework. Darknet is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA, which means it's efficient and outperforms TensorFlow/PyTorch in terms of training times for similar networks. However, it may feel slightly less intuitive to a Python programmer. This notebook will guide you through the setup process. You should execute these cells on the GCP instance."

    "In the previous lab you implemented the forward pass of a basic CNN in CUDA. The Darknet framework works in the same way - CNN layers are defined in CUDA such that they can be calculated on GPUs - but it also has a lot more functionality than what you implemented. For instance, there are libraries of different activation functions, layer types, and loss functions all implemented in CUDA and C that can be combined to generate complex model architectures. To get a better sense of how Darknet is combining CPU and GPU functionality to complete the computations necessary for Deep Learning, take a look at **darknet/src**. This directory contains the Darknet source code for individual model operations."
